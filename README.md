## Introduction
The Android app **SimpleDo** let's you note down tasks and appointments by creating colorful cards with a text and an optional date.
At the same time it is also possible to sort these cards by any criterion you like or by drag and drop.
If you want the app to display a notification for a certain task you can set a reminder.
